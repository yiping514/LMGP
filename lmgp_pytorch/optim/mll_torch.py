    '''Optimize the likelihood/posterior of a standard GP model using `torch.optim.Adam`.

    This is a convenience function that covers many situations for optimizing a standard GP model.
    Note that using L-BFGS through `fit_model_scipy` function is a better optimization strategy.

    :param model: A model instance derived from the `models.GPR` class. Can also pass a instance
        inherting from `gpytorch.models.ExactGP` provided that `num_restarts=0` or 
        the class implements a `.reset_parameters` method.
    :type model: models.GPR

    :param model_param_groups: list of parameters to optimizes or dicts defining parameter
        groups. If `None` is specified, then all parameters with `.requires_grad`=`True` are 
        included. Defaults to `None`.
    :type model_param_groups: list, optional

    :param lr_default: The default learning rate for all parameter groups. To use different 
        learning rates for some groups, specify them `model_param_groups`. 
    :type lr_default: float, optional

    :param num_iter: The number of optimization steps from each starting point. This is the only
        termination criterion for the optimizer.
    :type num_iter: float, optional

    :param num_restarts: The number of times to restart the local optimization from a 
        new starting point. Defaults to 5
    :type num_restarts: int, optional

    :returns: the best (negative) log-likelihood/log-posterior found
